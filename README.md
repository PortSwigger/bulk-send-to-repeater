# bulkSendToRepeater

The bulkSendToRepeater extension adds context menus to Burp Suite's request viewers, allowing requests to be forwarded to the Repeater tool in bulk.

* Requests may be added using their method and URI as Repeater Tab title (e.g., GET /api/v1/some/endpoint/1), limited to 70 characters, or
* Requests may be added using standard numbering for the Repeater Tab title
